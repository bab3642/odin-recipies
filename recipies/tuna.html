    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is my favorite recipe for a tuna sandwich. It combines two well known recipies to make a killer, tasty tuna sandwich that is not to
        dry and still has a nice crunch. My wife and I eat it at least once a week! Make sure you use good quality tuna to
        really enhance the flavor.

        This recipe feeds my wife and I for 2 meals (4 servings total). Give it a try, I know you will love it!
