# odin-recipies
This is my recipies project from TOP

I am setting this project up to build a basic recipies website. When finished, it will show that I know basic HTML (boilerplate, head, title, body, paragraph, bold/italicized text, images, links) and git commands (push, commit, clone, log, pull, etc, add [staging], commit -m, push origin main)
